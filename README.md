# TicTacToe

A game between two players (X and O) on a 3x3 grid, where each player tries to place 3 of their symbols in a row while preventing other player to do so.


The goal of the project was to practice the use of 2D arrays and creating an environment where two players get to play a simple game. Simple logic had to be used for tracking player's turns and the state of their decesions made during gameplay.


USAGE:

The application was made on and for Windows 10 platform using Visual Studio 2019. The project contains the executable for running the application (EXE folder), Visual Studio 2019 solution and the source code. 

When testing on another Windows machine apart from the one on which it was developed, it was found that running the .exe files sometimes doesn't work on the first try so the user needs to try again until the game can be played. The source code is also present so the user can also manually rebuild the program.
